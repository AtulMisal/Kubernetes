Taint & Toleration

  Taint - It will act as a filter on nodes. Suppose we have to assign a pods to specific worker nodes then we will add taint on them.      
	  kubectl taint node node_name size=large:NoSchedule

  To remove a taint -
      kubectl taint node node_name size-
	  
	      Here with help of NoSchedule will tell to the cluster that if the pod not have this tolerance then it will not schedule on that node.
		    We have 3 different typese as -
		      1. NoSchedule        -- With this the pod will not schedule on node if he don't have tolerance.
			    2. PreferNoSchedule  -- May or may not be scheduled.
			    3. NoExecute         -- It will not scheduled but if other pods are running on that node it will delete that all pods.
		  
  Toleration - It will be given to pods so that it can tolerate that node.
    Operator -
            1. Equal -- It will check the value and key if matches will assign the pod to that node.
		      	2. Exists - It will only check the key if key is present it will assign the pod. It will not check the value only key will be checked.
